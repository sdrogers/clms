Closed Loop Mass Spectrometry Project

Reinforcement learning to improve mass spectrometry fragmentation process.

- Interface: contains codes to interface with Thermo Tribid mass spectrometry using [IAPI](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/iapi).
- PeakDetector: trains a classifier to distinguish between chromatographic peaks and non-peaks signals.
- Simulator: contains simulator codes to generate new data
