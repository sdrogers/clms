How to install
==============

1. Install Python 3.6.5.
2. Install pipenv (https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
3. In this directory, run `$ pipenv install` to create a new virtual environment and install all the packages we need.
4. For IAPI assembly binding to work, copy the file `python.exe.config` to the same folder as the Python interpreter in the virtual environment.
5. Run jupyter notebook. Examples are available in the `notebooks` folder.
